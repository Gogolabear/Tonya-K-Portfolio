<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tonya Keeler, it's nice to "meet" you! You see, I have many loves that I've made into jobs. Before we get to all that though
  we should learn the basics about me. First, I live in Edinboro PA a small college town. I am from Albion PA, a farming town. I went
  to Edinboro University of PA for my BA in Cinema then returned for an MA in Art Education. I am an artist, always, but I loved
  teaching about art so I dabbled in teaching as well. I still very much enjoy teaching but I had another love I never thought to
  explore. Technology! I've designed websites, art wise before and even made a website during High School. I wanted more though!

  So around my 3rd year teaching I said "I want to challenge myself, I want to code" so I got a bootcamp course and began coding.
  I found it quite easy at first, mostly because I've done HTML before but the difficulty did come and I found myself challenged.
  I enjoy pushing myself, to learn new things and to try new things and coding is not only technical but also creative. It scratched the itch 
  perfectly!

  This portfolio is ever changing, I am always trying new things. So, I hope this about me gave you some info
  about me. Thanks for stopping in, now go make something!
